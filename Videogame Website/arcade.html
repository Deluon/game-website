				<h2>Arcade</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know arcade games. Those big colorful boxes that just call you to it, with promises of either a good fight or the opportunity to kill some aliens. Certain kinds still hold popularity today but many have sadly gone to the wayside. Here we talk about some of the more popular arcade devices and of course, some popular games!</p>
				<h3>Pinball</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know this one. it's in every arcade calling to us with whimsical noises, colorful lights, and iconic characters! Pinball is pretty much the same no matter how you slice it, you use two paddles to keep a metal ball running over key points, every little thing earning you a point. The catch is, you can't let the metal ball get by the paddles or you lose a life. The reason this is here is that each pinball machine is different, some featuring Donald Duck, others featuring Star Wars characters with sounds and lights to match the respective themes.</p>
				<h3>Upright Cabinet</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No not like where you keep your glasses and plates. This is the most recognized type of arcade video game in North America. These devices consist of a monitor, coin slot, colorful art decorations, a marquee, or illuminated title over the screen, a control panel of either buttons, a gun, or a joystick/button combo. There were many popular games on this device, from Pac-Man, to Mortal Kombat, and Area 51. Area 51 is a personal favorite. It is a "shooter on rails" meaning the player has no camera or movement control. The game was played with the gun control mentioned above, and the objective was to shoot all of the aliens.</p>
				<h3>Sit-Down Simulator</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;These were cool games when they were found. Often they would feature some sort of enclosed space, sometimes mobile sometimes not. They were there to really immerse the player in the game they were playing, as there was often an oversized screen as well. Some of you may have seen the "Afterburner" style of this game, or perhaps the "Jurassic Park" shooter? The Jurassic Park shooter featured an immobile wooden bench and your goal was to survive, shooting carnivores that game at you. This game has lost popularity.</p>
