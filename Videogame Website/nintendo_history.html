				<h2>History of Nintendo</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know Nintendo, the corporation spitting out games and consoles known the world over, and one of the biggest powerhouses in the business. This company found its roots back farther than you probably thought. This company has been around since the late 1800's, that's certainly quite a time line. They started off as a small Japanese company that made handmade cards called hanafuda cards. They were essentially playing cards that were made after foreign playing cards were banned in Japan. Nintendo continued making cards exclusively all the way from 1889 to 1956, when they began playing with some new ideas. While dominating already in the card market, Nintendo made a deal with Disney to add Disney characters to their cards and sell them with a booklet describing all of the different games one could play with these cards. The ploy succeeded and Nintendo flooded the market with cards. During this time, they attempted to try some other ideas including but not limited to a taxi service and toy making. None of the side ventures went over as well as planned except for the toy making. After they had saturated the market with cards, they fell into a sea of debt.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;During an inspection, Hiroshi Yamauchi saw a robotic hand that a maintenance employee had made and got the idea to  market it as a toy. "Ultra Hand" was a success and Nintendo's first toy blockbuster. They promptly hired Gunpei Yokoi into the development team and he began creating some of the most popular electronics Nintendo put out, including the precursor to the Nintendo Beam Gun. In 1972, Nintendo began dabbling in the field of video games, creating the Magnavox Oddessey, their first game system. This system used the light-gun technology for a shooting game called the Shooting Gallery. It was from here that Nintendo really took off, creating what seems like system after system. They developed the Nintendo Famicom, which was the predecessor to one of the most popular gaming systems to ever come out: The Nintendo Entertainment System &#40;NES&#41;.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we had "The Brick", the original GameBoy Hand-held system in 1989, selling much better than any hand-held console of it's time due to its durability and lack of screen-rot. It was around the time that the Super Nintendo Entertainment System &#40;SNES&#41; was put out that Nintendo made a deal with Sony to take advantage of the new CD systems that were coming out. They had a hand in the precursors to the PlayStation game system before turning to Phillips for what they hoped was a more lucrative deal. The project never came through and they gained a rival in the gaming industry. They continued to make some consoles that today are little-known and thus won't be discussed, but also created the Nintendo 64 in 1996. From there it was the GameBoy Color in 1998, and then the Nintendo GameCube in 2001. They are now creating advanced touch screen hand-held consoles and motion-sensor consoles that we all enjoy today.</p>
