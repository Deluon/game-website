				<h2>History of PlayStation</h2>
				<p class="history">The PlayStation system was not always as we know it today. Ken Kutaragi created the system over the course of some years and releases of earlier models. Some of these models included the SNES CD Add-on, which was the SNES with a disk drive to give it more power, the SNES PlayStation Standalone Console, and then finally, the PlayStation itself. This was a period when it was a footrace to master this relatively new technology, as all of the major electronic companies were also trying to get a starting and lasting foothold in the industry. Nintendo had promised to help this process along with Sony by having them add a disk drive for their games to the cartridge console. Nintendo would still control all licencing for their cartridge technology but Sony would take licencing for the software and the manufacturing of the media. This deal did not allow Nintendo any access to the technology and they did not find the idea appealing as it cut them out of a potential fortune. Sony had the upper hand however so there was nothing they could do. It was shortly after this that Nintendo broke their deal with Sony and went with Phillips instead, as it was more lucrative. This enraged the head of the Sony corporation, who said "Just do it." when Ken Kutaragi came in urging her to release a new console using only their technology. Thus the PlayStation X (PSX) was born.</p>
