				<h2>Brief History of Gaming Consoles</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;While video games were first introduced in the 1950's on massive computers connected to something called a vector display, the first video game console did not rear it's head until the 1960's when Ralph H. Baer came out with what he called "The Brown Box". This device was the predecessor of the Magnavox Odyssey, the first console commercially available in 1972. Following this, the Atari was born, one of the most popular consoles of it's time and probably one of the first most of you remember. Home consoles lost popularity for a time, but you can't keep a good product down. In 1983, Nintendo released the Family Computer or Famicom, the predecessor to their most popular system, the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES. Atari was able to scratch up a little bit of profit from their next system the Atari 7800, but it gained little popularity compared to the NES and fell to the wayside.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortly after this that Nintendo made the biggest breakthrough in video gaming since Pong; the GameBoy. This hand held console made Nintendo the dominant market in hand held consoles, a title they still hold despite the current releases of other hand held consoles by other companies. Following this, Sega reduced the size of their consoles and soon came out with the Sega Genesis, one of the more powerful consoles of it's time. While they did not do well in Japan, the rest of the world loved it and sales sky-rocketed. It was in 1990 that Nintendo came out with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES, and that same year, Sega created their company's most iconic character: Sonic the Hedgehog. Needless to say, this made the Genesis incredibly popular and a competitor for the SNES.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;About midway into the fourth generation of consoles, CD technology started appearing and Nintendo partnered with Sony in an attempt to utilize this technology, though the deal did not go over well and Nintendo broke the deal with Sony, thinking they would make more money with Phillips. Sony got mad at this course of action and came out with their own console in 1994 using this technology and dubbing their product PlayStation. It's fair to say that Nintendo helped create the company who today is their direct competitor in the video gaming industry. While other consoles had been experimenting with 3d technology by adding chips to their cartridges that would allow 3d polygon graphics, PlayStation would dominate the market as one of the best consoles of it's time, selling over 100 million consoles using the CD technology. This allowed Sony an edge over both Nintendo and Sega in the long run.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nintendo was the last to come out with a fifth generation console that used 3d graphics, the Nintendo 64. However, due to the fact that they still relied on cartridges for their console, may developers were drawn to the PlayStation. With that and other factors, the Nintendo 64 was the last console to use cartridges and the outdated technology soon went the way of the Dodo, except in their hand held consoles which to this day still use cartridges of ever decreasing size and ever increasing data storage. Today we use DVDs to write our games, giving us the ability to create stunning landscapes, breathtaking cut scenes and phenomenal voice overs (in most cases) making it feel as though we are controlling a movie rather than playing a game. </p>
